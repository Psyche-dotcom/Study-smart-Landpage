          <h4>Knowing Your Learning Style</h4>
          <h3 className="last_H3">H.O Lawal</h3>
          <p>
            Learning makes up a studentâ€˜s entire life on campus. Either online
            or on-site, from a colleague or a lecturer, you must learn one thing
            or the other. It is inevitable! At the end of the semester, you will
            be tested, assessed, and graded on how well you have achieved from
            learning. Have you ever thought about your best way of learning
            things? Do you learn best by LISTENING, SEEING, or READING? Or do
            you understand better when you are allowed toDO it with your HANDS?
            Can you still REMEMBER that quote, verse, memory lane, a poem you
            can never forget, and how you assimilated it? Do you read it
            yourself or do you commit it to memory by listening to others? All
            of these are some of the determinants that influence learning styles
            and as a student, the need to identify your learning style is very
            crucial.{" "}
          </p>
          <h5>WHAT IS A LEARNING STYLE?</h5>
          <p>
            Learning style is a distinct way of learning. You need to note that
            learning effectively is accompanied by your unique learning style.
            Your style is natural and distinct in its way. You can achieve your
            learning goals with it. You and your friend might share different
            learning styles and still learn effectively if everyone should stick
            to his/her best learning style. To discover your best learning style
            you need to assess yourself with the VARK questionnaire.
          </p>
          <h5>WHAT IS VARK? </h5>
          <p>
            VARK is a self-report inventory developed by Neil Fleming in 1987 to
            help students learn more about their individual learning preferences
          </p>
          <p>V stands for VISUAL / SEEING </p>
          <p>A stands for AUDIO / LISTENING </p>
          <p>R stands for READING / WRITING </p>
          <p>K stands for KINESTHETIC / DOING</p>
          <h5>THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT VARK </h5>
          <p>
            You, as an individual have a preferred learning style, while some
            other people may have more than one learning style. Then, you should
            also note that one particular style is not better than the others
            and a preferred style does not mean you cannot learn in other
            styles. The good news is that knowing your best style of learning
            would make you a better learner and achieve more while receiving,
            processing, and retaining information. Now, you should be ready to
            identify your own unique and best way of learning.
          </p>
          <h5>ARE YOU A VISUAL, AUDIO, READ/WRITE or KINESTHETIC LEARNER?</h5>
          <p>
            Pick up a pen and paper and respond to this questionnaire. It has 16
            items with four options (V.A.R.K.).{" "}

            Choose the answer which best explains your preference and circle the
            letter(s) (V, A, R, K) next to it. Please circle more than one if a
            single answer does not match your perceptions. Leave blank, any
            question that does not apply.
