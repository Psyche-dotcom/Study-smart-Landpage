          <h3>CHAPTER FIVE </h3>
          <h4>Improve Your Memory</h4>
          <h3 className="last_H3">M.O Lawal</h3>
          <p>
            To start with, cast your mind back to when you were still a teenager
            and imagine how you learn information (names, things, letters of the
            alphabet, numbers, words…), remember those pieces of information,
            and even put them into use in dayto-day living. Even in primary
            schools then, no one studies. We didn't know there was anything like
            reading and preparing for exams. Maybe until we get to the
            terminating classes of primary education that we are forced to read
            and that goes on in our secondary education in the same way.
            Buttressing the saying that goes thus ―the higher you go the more
            difficult everything gets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, the saying is very true because if you cast your mind back to
            how you remember things while in primary school and secondary school
            and try to make a comparison between them, you will realize there
            are changes. What helps us learn, store, process, and recall
            information is the brain. Memory is an important part of the brain
            where pieces of information from our surroundings are stored. So
            now, imagine if such changes exist between how the memory works
            while you‘re in primary and secondary schools. You‘ll definitely
            know there is a need to improve your memory as you go on. Thus, it
            is necessary to understand memory.
          </p>
          <h5>WHAT IS THIS MEMORY? </h5>
          <p>
            Memory, according to Wikipedia, is the faculty of the brain that
            encodes, stores, and retrieves information when needed. It is the
            retention of information over time to influence future action. Think
            of the human memory as a physical library where you can walk in to
            pick any piece of information for use. Yes, that's pretty much what
            the human brain (memory) seems to like. Though this is hypothetical,
            the functionality of the memory is just like such. It can be divided
            into compartments, units, and sections with retrieval keys. We have
            sensory memory, shortterm memory, and long-term memory. Memory can
            also be viewed as the store of things learned and retained from an
            organism‘s activity or experience as evidenced by modification of
            structure or behaviour or by recall and recognition. If past events
            could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language,
            relationships, or personal identity to develop. Memory loss is
            usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia.
          </p>
          <h5>WHAT CAN YOUR MEMORY DO? </h5>
          <p>
            The main processes of memory functioning are encoding, storing, and
            retrieval.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Encoding</span> is the process through which information from
            the environment through the various sensory organs is received and
            interpreted in neural signs the brain can understand for storage.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Storing</span> is the process of properly keeping the pieces
            of information safe for later usage. While <span>retrieval</span> is
            the process of recalling previously stored information for use when
            needed.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Memory is understood as an information processing system with
            explicit and implicit functions consisting of sensory processors,
            short-term (or work) memory, and long-term memory. Memory is not a
            perfect processor and can be affected by many factors (such as pain,
            amount of attention, physical damage to the brain, inappropriate
            cues, and decay within long-term memory).
          </p>

          <h6>FORMS OF MEMORY </h6>

          <h5>SENSORY MEMORY </h5>
          <p>
            This holds information, derived from the senses, less than one
            second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item
            and remember what it looked like with just a split second of
            observation, or memorization, is an example of sensory memory. It is
            out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very
            short presentations, participants often report that they seem to
            "see" more than they can report.{" "}
          </p>
          <h5>SHORT-TERM MEMORY </h5>
          <p>
            This is also known as working memory. Short-term memory allows
            recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without
            rehearsal. Its capacity, however, is very limited.{" "}
          </p>
          <h5>LONG-TERM MEMORY </h5>
          <p>
            The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a
            strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that
            information, is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, while the
            total capacity of long-term memory has yet to be established, it can
            store much larger quantities of information. Furthermore, it can
            store this information for a much longer duration, potentially for a
            whole life span. While short-term memory encodes information
            acoustically, longterm memory encodes it semantically.{" "}
          </p>
          <h6>HERE'S A QUICK FACT </h6>
          <p>
            More than 80% of everything the brain is exposed to has been
            captured but the issue is recollection and recovery of those events.
            How to go about recalling all those events or activities is summed
            up to improving one's memory. The need to improve your memory is a
            prerequisite to your personal development because with memory an
            individual is suffering from what is called amnesia.
          </p>
          <h5>HOW CAN I IMPROVE MY MEMORY</h5>
          <p>
            Is it really possible to improve your memory? If you've ever found
            yourself forgetting where you left your keys or blanking out
            information on important tests then you have probably wished that
            your memory was a bit better. Fortunately, there are plenty of
            things that you can do to help improve your memory. Utilizing some
            sort of reminder system can help. Setting up an online calendar that
            sends reminders to your phone helps you keep track of all those
            appointments and meetings. Creating daily to-do lists can ensure
            that you don't forget important tasks that need to be completed.
          </p>
          <h6>THE ELEVEN PROVEN STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE YOUR MEMORY </h6>
          <p>
            Scientific research carried out on this particular topic has
            provided eleven (11) steps, methods, and procedures to undertake in
            developing or improving your memory. Before your next big exam, be
            sure to check out some of these tried and tested techniques for
            improving memory. These 11 research-proven strategies can
            effectively improve memory, enhance recall, and increase retention
            of information. These procedures include the following:{" "}

              <h5> 1. FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION </h5>
              <p className="first_para">
                Attention is one of the major components of memory. For
                information to move from your short-term memory into your
                long-term memory, you need to actively attend to this
                information. Try to study in a place free of distractions such
                as television, music, and other diversions.{" "}
              </p>
              <p className="space-left">
                Getting rid of distractions might be a challenge, especially if
                you are surrounded by rowdy roommates or noisy children. Set
                aside a short period to be alone. Ask your roommates to give you
                some space or ask your partner to take the kids for an hour so
                you can focus on your work.{" "}

              <p>
                Studying materials over many sessions gives you the time you
                need to adequately process information. Research has
                continuously shown that students who study regularly remember
                the material far better than those who do all of their studying
                in one marathon session.{" "}

              <h5>3. STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZE </h5>

              <p className="space-left">
                Researchers have found that information is organized in memory
                in related clusters. You can take advantage of this by
                structuring and organizing the materials you're studying. Try
                grouping similar concepts and terms together, or outline your
                notes and textbook readings to help with group-related concepts.

              <h5>4. UTILIZE MNEMONIC DEVICES </h5>

              <p className="space-left">
                This is a technique often used by students to aid in recall. A
                mnemonic is simply a way to remember information. For example,
                you might associate a term you need to remember with a common
                item that you are very familiar with. The best mnemonics are
                those that utilize positive imagery, humour, or novelty. Come up
                with a rhyme, song, or joke to help remember a specific segment
                of information.{" "}

            <div className="Questions">
              <h5>5. ELABORATE AND REHEARSE </h5>

              <p className="space-left">
                To recall information, you need to encode what you are studying
                into long-term memory. One of the most effective encoding
                techniques is known as the elaborative rehearsal. An example of
                this technique would be to read the definition of a key term,
                study the definition of that term, and then read a more detailed
                description of what that term means. After repeating this
                process a few times, you'll probably notice that recalling the
                information is much easier.{" "}

              <h5>6. VISUALIZE CONCEPTS </h5>

              <p className="space-left">
                Many people benefit greatly from visualizing the information
                they study. Pay attention to the photographs, charts, and other
                graphics in your textbooks. If you don't have visual cues to
                help, try creating your own. Draw charts or figures in the
                margins of your notes or use highlighters or pens in different
                colours to group related ideas in your written study materials.
                Sometimes, even just making flashcards of various terms you need
                to remember can help cement information in your mind.{" "}

              <p className="first_para">
                When you're studying unfamiliar material, take the time to think
                about how this information relates to what you already know. By
                establishing relationships between new ideas and previously
                existing memories, you can dramatically increase the likelihood
                of recalling the recently learned information.

                Researches suggest that reading materials out loud significantly
                improves the quick recall of the content of the material.
                Educators and psychologists have also discovered that having
                students teach new concepts to others enhances understanding and
                recall. Use this approach in your studies by teaching new
                concepts and information to a friend or study partner.

                Have you ever noticed how it's sometimes easier to remember the
                information at the beginning or end of a chapter? Researchers
                have found that the order of information can play a role in the
                recall, which is known as the{" "}

                Another strategy is to try restructuring what you have learned

                Another great way to increase your recall is to occasionally
                change your study routine. If you're accustomed to studying in
                one specific location, try moving to a different spot during
                your next study session. If you study in the evening, try
                spending a few minutes each morning reviewing the information
                you studied the previous night. By adding an element of novelty
                to your study sessions, you can increase the effectiveness of
                your efforts and significantly improve your long-term recall.
